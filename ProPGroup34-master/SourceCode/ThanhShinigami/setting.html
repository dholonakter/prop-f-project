                        <p>Guthix, the god of balance, and the last survivng member of the Naragi race, was the first of the young gods to arrive to Gielinor. He became a god at the end of a war between gods on his realm, which saw the deaths of all his friends and family. By killing the god Skargaroth, he ascended to godhood himself, after which he left his devastated world. Soon after, he discovered Gielinor, and, astonished by its beauty, shaped it to his liking for mortals to live on it without interference from gods. He brought races including the humans, sheep and elves. He believed in the concept of balance, and brought the aforementioned races - who had no concepts of the gods and no inclination to either good or evil - to Gielinor to live in harmony with their surroundings and allowed them to make their own choices so the balance between good and evil would be maintained. He then populated the world and created runestones for its inhabitants to use. He descended into a slumber, hoping to be forgotten by his worshippers, but other gods began to arrive in the following centuries.</p>

                        <p>During Guthix's slumber, many gods start to arrive on Gielinor, establishing territories and gaining followers. Many gods would introduce their own races to Gielinor. Many more gods existed during the Second Age than today; the exact number is unknown, but it may have exceeded twenty. These gods either allied with the more powerful gods on the plane during this time, perished during the God Wars that followed this age, or fled the plane during either period. 2 of the most well-known gods were Zaros and Saradomin. Zaros took control of the political structure of Gielinor, creating the Zarosian Empire, and teaching the ways of magic through violence. Saradomin was represented by those who rebelled against Zaros' rule. While Zaros was on Gielinor, leading his people, the followers of Saradomin could only hold on to the belief that Saradomin was with them in spirit. The Second Age came to a close when Zamorak, leader of Zaros' army, betrayed Zaros, killing him, and achieving godhood. He obtained the Staff of Armadyl which granted him great power. Thus, Saradomin made his move and showed himself on Gielinor, leading to the third Age.</p>

                        <p>The Third Age, also known as The God Wars, is one of the six ages of Gielinor. The Third Age lasted four thousand years and officially began when Zamorak, returning from his banishment as a god, began a war to retrieve the Stone of Jas which had been previously confiscated from him by Saradomin in the previous age. This war, also known as the God Wars, would span through the entire age and saw many significant events that shape the world even today, most dominated by war and the gods.</p>

                        <p>They only ended when Zamorak, cornered by Saradomin, Armadyl, and Bandos in Forinthry, used the Stone of Jas as a last ditch effort to save himself. This would result in the whole of Forinthry being destroyed, scarring the land so harshly that nothing would ever grow. Meanwhile, the druids of Guthix had been attempting to end the war by waking the god of balance; four of them, Atrew, Thera, Ria and Rief, conducted a ritual that succeeded in doing so. Guthix, horrified and saddened deeply by the destruction he saw, slammed a giant blade into the middle of Forinthry (what is now known as the Wilderness Volcano) establishing the Edicts of Guthix. These edicts banished most current gods from Gielinor, and prevented new ones from coming to the planet so that nobody could destroy it further.</p>

Heroes from this age include Arrav and Camorra, both of whom have a statue in the Heroes' Guild. This was the age of peace, where Guthix monitored the lands. No chaos arrised that couldn't be taken care of. Many discoveries were made, like the mysteries that lies within the runes, the world beyond ours, the fairies and gnomes mysteries, as well the the long life of the trees and natures of which the elves protected. The age soon came to an end with the death of Guthix.</p>

                        <p>Guthix, the god of balance, was assassinated by the hands fo the Zarosian Mahjarrat Sliske, who assumed the position of godhood. With Guthix essences lying within the core of Gielinor, Zamorak and Saradomin fought for the power, thus starting the The Battle of Lumbridge. The two fought hard, and resulted with Saradomin winning in the end. Guthix had remaining essences leaked all over the lands, of which humans discovered, improving their Divination.</p>

                        <p>Sliske gained the attention of the gods, as it is truly difficult to kill Guthix. Sliske soon caused mayhem, by kidnapping Death himself. Souls were tied to their dead bodies, causing disturbances around the land. He then invited the gods to contest with him, over a game, and the price being the Stone of Jas, the item the gods fought dearly for in the Second Age. One event lead to another after the death of Guthix. War spread among the lands, not only through people, but also gods. In the third year, Tuska, a boar-like goddness who attacked Naragun during the Naragi god wars, heard of the death of Guthix. Guthix was the only god who could stop her from her destructive nature of consuming worlds, one after the other. She immediately headed to Gielinor. The gods agreed to a temporary truce to defeat this beast before it devoured the world of Gielinor. This was a diversion for Sliske's true plan. He was keeping the souls that remained on Gielinor to form his own powerful god.</p>
                        
                        <p>The moon Zanaris had finally covered the sun from Gielinor. There each gods arrived to their fortress or camp site. Armadyl at his divine focus tower alone, Saradomin at the White Knights' Castle gathering his forces with his commanders, Zilyana who was looking at the horizon and Padomenes who began training the forces of Saradomin. Zamorak had arrived at the Kinshra's fortress presenting himself to his followers and aligned warriors there. The gods were all invited to meet up at the Heart of Gielinor, to finally compete for the Stone of Jas. Vorago, Death, Icthlarin, Brassica, the adventurer and Marimbo also attended the game, with Marimbo and Brassica both leaving the contest due to little interest towards the Stone. The Dragonkin were also part of the contest, ending with the Stone of Jas being destroyed and Sliske's death.</p>
