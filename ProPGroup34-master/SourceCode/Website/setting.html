                    <h3>The world</h3>
                    <p>The five elements (fire, earth, water, air and magic) created the world of Aryandell and the first life therein: the culture of the Wise Rulers, who continued on to fathom the secrets of their world and even created new life themselves.</p>
                    <p>But once the Rulers had discovered and attained everything, some of them decided to outdo their creators (the elements) and thus created the Forbidden Elements which weren’t part of the original grand plan of the elements.</p>
                    <p>These Ancient Sceptics were sent into exile by the other Wise Rulers and so they fled into the otherworls, their own creation, leaving behind an Aryandell where their ideas and creations lived on without them.</p>
                    <p>The students of the Ancient Sceptics and the Wise Rulers of the elements couldn’t come to an agreement and so their culture was destroyed and the whole world plunged into a war that should culminate in burning it completely, an event known as the Realmfire.</p>
                    <p>The elements banished even their own followers and stipulated that only after a thousand generations had come and gone their heirs would be able to return and again settle in this world, thereby also facing the enemies their ancestors had created, their responsibility.</p>
                    <p>Few years later war was raging all over the world again, between the settlers and adventurers of the elements and the four great forces of the Forbidden: Black Ice, Undead Flesh, Void and Pestilence.</p>

                    <h3>Last Year</h3>
                    <p>The Forbidden suprised everyone, by launching a counter attack on Aryandell. But the Elements warriors did not yield but fought back and recaptured the fortress although it took the lives of many heroes and adventureres. This was a great victory but not the end of the enemy. The Worldforge is in danger for as long as the mirrorworld exists. And through it, all of Aryandell!</p>
                </div>

                <div class="setting">

                    <h3>This Year</h3>
                    <p>This year will be about holding and defending the fortress taken the year before, because the Ancient Sceptics will surely try to conquer it to get access to the Worldforge again. But they are almost beaten and it will probably be their last struggle, so it is also important to destroy all connections between the otherworld and Aryandell for good to ensure a lasting victory.</p>
